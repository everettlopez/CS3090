# Block 2 Project

This repository will be a place to store additional side projects that may not directly be correlated to courses at the University of Utah. Having a basic repository to store code as your progress and learn is important to reference old work and even make additional updates. Although many times GitHub is used for team projects, this can easily be a personal "database" for your code to be stored and accessed no matter the device.
